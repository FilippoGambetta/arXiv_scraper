      "A complete thermodynamic analysis of a quantum measurement processnecessitates a method for obtaining higher moments of thermodynamic quantities,such as work, heat, and entropy production. While such a method is provided bythe eigenstate trajectory approach of stochastic quantum thermodynamics,conceptual difficulties are encountered when the quantum system being measuredis degenerate; an infinite possibility of eigen-decompositions of the quantumstate results in infinitely many sets of eigenstat \n",

      "Optomechanical systems are promising platforms for controlled light-matterinteractions. They are capable of providing several fundamental and practicalnovel features when the mechanical oscillator is cooled down to nearly reachits ground state. In this framework, measuring the effective temperature of theoscillator is perhaps the most relevant step in the characterization of thosesystems. In conventional schemes, the cavity is driven strongly, and theoverall system is well-described by a linear  \n",

Even though experimentally demanding,it provides appealing verification schemes for advanced quantum technologiesthat naturally fulfil the associated requirements. In this work, weexperimentally study whether self-testing protocols can be adopted to certifythe proper functioning of new quantum devices \n",

For most physicalimplementations, however, it may be advantageous to explore state componentsand interactions that depart from this universal paradigm and offer faster ormore robust access to more advanced operations on the system. In this article,we show that adiabatic passage along the dark eigenstate of excitation exchangeinteractions can be used to implement fast multi-qu \n",
