# arXiv_scraper
A simple IPython notebook to search for newly uploaded arXiv papers matching with a given set of keywords.

Currently, it is possible to search through arXiv "new" sections only (e.g. https://arxiv.org/list/cond-mat/new, https://arxiv.org/list/quant-ph/new, etc...)

Keywords can be imported from an external txt file or inserted as a list of strings.

This notebook has been inspired by
