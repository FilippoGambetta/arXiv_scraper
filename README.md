# arXiv_scraper
A simple ipynb notebook to search new arXiv papers matching with a given set of keywords.

Currently, it is possible to search through main arXiv sections only, e.g. https://arxiv.org/list/cond-mat/new, https://arxiv.org/list/quant-ph/new, etc...)

Keywords can be inserted from an external txt file or as a list of strings.
