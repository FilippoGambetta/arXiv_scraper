      "In the field of frustrated magnetism, Kitaev models provide a unique framework to study the phenomena of spin fractionalization and emergent lattice gauge theories in two and three spatial dimensions. Their ground states are quantum spin liquids, which can typically be described in terms of a Majorana band structure and an ordering of the underlying $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge structure. Here we provide a comprehensive classification of the \"gauge physics\" of a family of elementary three-dimensional Kitaev models, discussing how their thermodynamics and ground state order depends on the underlying lattice geometry. Using large-scale, sign-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations we show that the ground-state gauge order can generally be understood in terms of the length of elementary plaquettes -- a result which extends the applicability of Lieb's theorem to lattice geometries beyond its original scope. At finite temperatures, the proliferation of (gapped) vison excitations destroys the gauge order at a critical temperature scale, which we show to correlate with the size of vison gap for the family of three-dimensional Kitaev models. We also discuss two notable exceptions where the lattice structure gives rise to \"gauge frustration\" or intertwines the gauge ordering with time-reversal symmetry breaking. In a more general context, the thermodynamic gauge transitions in such 3D Kitaev models are one of the most natural settings for phase transitions beyond the standard Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm.  \n",

      "The interplay of spin-orbit interaction and geometric frustration of local Ir spins drives the long-range magnetic order in pyrochlore iridate family, R$_{2}$Ir$_{2}$O$_{7}$ (R = lanthanide), into a paramagnetic state at near-zero temperatures. Pr$_{2}$Ir$_{2}$O$_{7}$ lies at a tuning-free quantum critical point and exhibits a diverse array of complex phenomena including an underscreened Kondo effect, biquadratic band structure, metallic spin-liquid (MSL), and anomalous Hall effect$^{2-5}$. Using spectroscopic imaging with the scanning tunneling microscope, complemented with machine learning K-means clustering analysis, density functional theory, and theoretical modeling, we probe the electronic states in single crystal of Pr$_{2}$Ir$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and discover an unprecedented nanoscale electronic phase separation. Regions of heavy Fermi-liquid (HFL) with a well-defined Kondo resonance are interweaved with a non-magnetic metallic phase with Kondo-destruction that is suggestive of the candidate MSL. Remarkably, the spatial nanoscale patterns display a correlation-driven fractal geometry with power-law behavior extended over two and a half decades, consistent with being in proximity to a critical point. Our discovery reveals a new nanoscale tuning route to realize a MSL, viz. using a spatial variation of the electronic potential as a means of adjusting the balance between Kondo entanglement and geometric frustration.  \n",

      "Emergent behavior at complex oxide interfaces has driven much of the research in the oxide thin film community for the past twenty years. Interfaces have been engineered for potential applications in spintronics, topological quantum computing, and high-speed electronics in cases where the bulk materials would not exhibit the desired properties. Advances in thin film growth have made the synthesis of these interfaces possible, while surface characterization tools such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have been critical to understanding surface and interfacial phenomena in these materials. In this review we discuss the leading research in the oxide field over the past 5-10 years with a focus on connecting the key results to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies that enabled them. We describe how in situ integration of synthesis and spectroscopy can be used to improve the film growth process and to perform immediate experiments on specifically tailored interfacial heterostructures. These studies can include determination of interfacial intermixing, valence band alignment, and interfacial charge transfer. We also show how advances in synchrotron-based spectroscopy techniques have answered questions that cannot be addressed in a lab-based system. By further tying together synthesis and spectroscopy through in situ techniques, we conclude by discussing future opportunities in the field through the careful design of thin film heterostructures that are optimized for X-ray studies.  \n",

      "A sufficiently large perpendicular magnetic field quenches the kinetic (Fermi) energy of an interacting two-dimensional (2D) system of fermions, making them susceptible to the formation of a Wigner solid (WS) phase in which the charged carriers organize themselves in a periodic array in order to minimize their Coulomb repulsion energy. In low-disorder 2D electron systems confined to modulation-doped GaAs heterostructures, signatures of a magnetic-field-induced WS appear at low temperatures and very small Landau level filling factors ($\\nu\\simeq1/5$). In dilute GaAs 2D \\textit{hole} systems, on the other hand, thanks to the larger hole effective mass and the ensuing Landau level mixing, the WS forms at relatively higher fillings ($\\nu\\simeq1/3$). Here we report our measurements of the fundamental temperature vs. filling phase diagram for the 2D holes' WS-liquid \\textit{thermal melting}. Moreover, via changing the 2D hole density, we also probe their Landau level mixing vs. filling WS-liquid \\textit{quantum melting} phase diagram. We find our data to be in good agreement with the results of very recent calculations, although intriguing subtleties remain.  \n",

      "We propose a data-driven technique to estimate the spin Hamiltonian, including uncertainty, from multiple physical quantities. Using our technique, an effective model of KCu$_4$P$_3$O$_{12}$ is determined from the experimentally observed magnetic susceptibility and magnetization curves with various temperatures under high magnetic fields. An effective model, which is the quantum Heisenberg model on a zigzag chain with eight spins having $J_1= -8.54 \\pm 0.51 \\{\\rm meV}$, $J_2 = -2.67 \\pm 1.13 \\{\\rm meV}$, $J_3 = -3.90 \\pm 0.15 \\{\\rm meV}$, and $J_4 = 6.24 \\pm 0.95 \\{\\rm meV}$, describes these measured results well. These uncertainties are successfully determined by the noise estimation. The relations among the estimated magnetic interactions or physical quantities are also discussed. The obtained effective model is useful to predict hard-to-measure properties such as spin gap, spin configuration at the ground state, magnetic specific heat, and magnetic entropy.  \n",

We identify different scattering regimes as a function of the physical parameters such as the incident electronic energy, potential barrier, radius of quantum dot, gap and $\\phi$. We choose two values of the flux $\\phi=1/2, 3/2$ and show that for low energy of the incident electron, the scattering resonances appear and the far-field scattered current presents distinct preferred scattering directions.  \n",

      "In the correlated Stokes-anti--Stokes scattering ($SaS$) an incident photon interacts with a Raman-active material, creating a Stokes photon and exciting a quantum vibrational mode in the medium, which is posteriorly annihilated on contact with a second incident photon, producing in turn an anti-Stokes photon. This can be accomplished by real and virtual processes. In real process the quantum mode shared between the Stokes and anti-Stokes events is a real particle, whereas in virtual processes the pair formation is mediated by the exchange of virtual particles. Here, we introduce a Hamiltonian to describe the pair production in $SaS$ scattering, for both types of process, when stimulated by two orthogonally polarized laser pulses in a pump-and-probe configuration. We also model the effect of the natural decay of the vibration created in the Stokes event and compute the probability of producing $SaS$ pairs. Additionally, we follow the dynamics of the vibration by considering the Stokes and anti-Stokes fields as external reservoirs, obtaining thus a master equation for the reduced density matrix for the vibrational population. Finally, we compare our theoretical results with recently published experimental data.  \n",

      "The Lennard-Jones potential is perhaps one of the most widely-used models for the interaction of uncharged particles, such as noble gas solids. The phase diagram of the classical LJ solid is known to exhibit transitions between hcp and fcc phases. However, the phase behaviour of the quantum Lennard-Jones solid remains unknown. Thermodynamic integration based on path integral molecular dynamics and lattice dynamics calculations are used to study the phase stability of the hcp and fcc Lennard-Jones solids. The hcp phase is shown to be stabilized by quantum effects in PIMD while fcc is shown to be favoured by lattice dynamics, which suggests a possible re-entrant low pressure hcp phase for highly quantum systems. Implications for the phase stability of noble gas solids are discussed. For parameters equating to Helium, the expansion due to zero-point vibrations is associated with quantum melting: neither crystal structure is stable at zero pressure.  \n",

      "We use field-cycling-assisted dynamic nuclear polarization to demonstrate magnetic-field-dependent activation of nuclear spin transport from otherwise isolated strongly-hyperfine-coupled sites. With the help of a toy model comprising electron and nuclear spins, we recast our observations in terms of a dynamic phase diagram featuring zones of active or forbidden nuclear spin current separated by boundaries defined by the interplay between spin Zeeman, dipolar, and hyperfine couplings. Analysis of the polarization transport as a function of the driving field reveals the presence of many-body excitations stemming from the hybrid electron-nuclear nature of the system. These findings could prove relevant in applications to spin-based quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing.  \n",

      "The continuous coupling function in quantum impurity problems is exactly partitioned into a part represented by a finite size Wilson chain and a part represented by a set of additional reservoirs, each coupled to one Wilson chain site. These additional reservoirs represent high-energy modes of the environment neglected by the numerical renormalization group and are required to restore the continuum limit of the original problem. We present a hybrid time-dependent numerical renormalization group approach which combines an accurate numerical renormalization group treatment of the non-equilibrium dynamics on the finite size Wilson chain with a Bloch-Redfield formalism to include the effect of these additional reservoirs. Our approach overcomes the intrinsic shortcoming of the time-dependent numerical renormalization group approach induced by the bath discretization with a Wilson parameter $\\Lambda > 1$. We analytically prove that for a system with a single chemical potential, the thermal equilibrium reduced density operator is the steady-state solution of the Bloch-Redfield master equation. For the numerical solution of this master equation a Lanczos method is employed which couples all energy shells of the numerical renormalization group. The presented hybrid approach is applied to the real-time dynamics in correlated fermionic quantum-impurity systems. An analytical solution of the resonant-level model serves as a benchmark for the accuracy of the method which is then applied to non-trivial models, such as the interacting resonant-level model and the single impurity Anderson model.  \n",

      "We develop a general formalism for the magnetic oscillations (MO) in two dimensional (2D) systems. We consider general 2D Landau levels, which may depend on other variable or indices, besides the perpendicular magnetic field. In the ground state, we obtain expressions for the MO phase and amplitude. From this we use a Fourier expansion to write the MO, with the first term being a sawtooth oscillation. We also consider the effects of finite temperature, impurities or lattice imperfections, assuming a general broadening of the Landau levels. We develop two methods for describing these damping effects in the MO. One in terms of the occupancy of the Landau levels, the other in terms of reduction factors, which results in a generalization of the Lifshits-Kosevich (LK) formula. We show that the first approach is particularly useful at very low damping, when only the states close to the Fermi energy are excited. In contrast, the LK formula may be more convenient at higher damping, when only few terms are needed in its harmonic expansion. We compare different damping situations, showing how the MO are broadened in each case. The general formulation presented allows to relate the properties of the MO with those of the 2D systems.  \n",

      "Antiferromagnets display enormous potential in spintronics owing to its intrinsic nature, including terahertz resonance, multilevel states, and absence of stray fields. Combining with the layered nature, van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets hold the promise in providing new insights and new designs in two-dimensional (2D) spintronics. The zero net magnetic moments of vdW antiferromagnets strengthens the spin stability, however, impedes the correlation between spin and other excitation elements, like excitons. Such coupling is urgently anticipated for fundamental magneto-optical studies and potential opto-spintronic devices. Here, we report an ultra-sharp excitonic emission with excellent monochromaticity in antiferromagnetic nickel phosphorus trisulfides (NiPS3) from bulk to atomically thin flakes. We prove that the linear polarization of the excitonic luminescence is perpendicular to the ordered spin orientation in NiPS3. By applying an in-plane magnetic field to alter the spin orientation, we further manipulate the excitonic emission polarization. Such strong correlation between exciton and spins provides new insights for the study of magneto-optics in 2D materials, and hence opens a path for developing opto-spintronic devices and antiferromagnet-based quantum information technologies.  \n",

While large bulk gaps with vanishing edge gaps in atomically thin layers have been reported, verifications of the QSH phase by resistance measurements are comparatively few. This is partly due to the poor uniformity of the bulk gap induced by the substrate over a large sample area and/or defects induced by oxidation. Here, we report the observation of the QSH phase at room-temperature in the 1T'-phase of few-layer MoS2 patterned onto the 2H semiconducting phase using low-power and short-time laser beam irradiation. Two different resistance measurements reveal hallmark transport conductance values, ~e2/2h and e2/4h, as predicted by the theory. Magnetic-field dependence, scanning tunneling spectra, and calculations support the emergence of the room-temperature QSH phase. Although further experimental verification is still desirable, our results provide feasible application to room-temperature topological devices.  \n",

      "Experimental discovery of near-room-temperature (NRT) superconductivity in highly-compressed H$_3$S, LaH$_1$$_0$ and YH$_6$ restores fundamental interest to electron-phonon pairing mechanism in superconductors. One of prerequisites of phonon-mediated NRT superconductivity in highly-compressed hydrides is strong electron-phonon interaction, which can be quantified by dimensionless ratios of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory vs $k{_B}T{_c}$/(${\\hslash}$${\\omega}{_l}{_n}$), where Tc is the critical temperature and ${\\omega}{_l}{_n}$ is the logarithmic phonon frequency (Mitrovic et al. 1984 Phys. Rev. B 29 184). However, all known strong-coupling correction functions for BCS ratios are applicable for $k{_B}T{_c}$/(${\\hslash}$${\\omega}{_l}{_n}$)<0.20, which is not high enough $k{_B}T{_c}$/(${\\hslash}$${\\omega}{_l}{_n}$) range for NRT superconductors, because the latter exhibit variable values of 0.13 < $k{_B}T{_c}$/(${\\hslash}$${\\omega}{_l}{_n}$) < 0.32. In this paper, we reanalyze full experimental dataset (including data for highly-compressed H3S) and find that strong-coupling correction functions for the gap-to-critical-temperature ratio and for the specific-heat-jump ratio are doubled-valued nearly-linear functions of $k{_B}T{_c}$/(${\\hslash}$${\\omega}{_l}{_n}$).  \n",

      "The conventional ways to identify quantum phases of many-body systems often require priori knowledge on the order parameters. Therefore, their effectiveness is severely limited when dealing with the unconventional phases in, for instance, the topological models (1,2). In this work, we propose a different strategy to access quantum phases by visualization based on the distribution of ground states in Hilbert space. By mapping the quantum states in Hilbert space onto a two-dimensional feature space using an unsupervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction method (3, 4), the quantum states can be explicitly visualized, from which distinct phases can be easily specified and the phase transition point can be well identified. Our scheme is benchmarked on the phases of several strongly correlated spin systems, including gapped (5), critical (6), and topological phases (7, 8). As our strategy directly learns the quantum phases and phase transitions from the distributions of the quantum states, it does not depend on priori knowledge of order parameters or any other specific physical properties of the quantum systems. This work indicates a highly perceptual route to identify quantum phases and phase transitions particularly in the complex systems of condensed matter by visualization.  \n",

      "Polycrystalline samples of Sr1-xRExFBiS2 (RE: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm) were synthesized via the solid-state reaction and characterized using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Although all the Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2 samples exhibited superconductivity at transition temperatures (Tc) within the range of 2.1-2.7 K under ambient pressure, the estimated superconducting volume fraction was small. This indicated the non-bulk nature of superconductivity in these samples under ambient pressure. A dramatic evolution of the bulk superconducting phases was achieved on applying an external hydrostatic pressure. Near pressures below 1 GPa, bulk superconductivity was induced with a Tc of 2.5-2.8 K, which is termed as the low-P phase. Moreover, the high-P phase (Tc = 10.0-10.8 K) featuring bulk characteristics was observed at higher pressures. Pressure-Tc phase diagrams indicated that the critical pressure for the emergence of the high-P phase tends to increase with decreasing ionic radius of the doped RE ions. According to the high-pressure X-ray diffraction measurements of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2, a structural phase transition from tetragonal to monoclinic also occurred at approximately 1.1 GPa. Thus, this phase transition indicates a pressure-induced superconducting-superconducting transition similar to the transition in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Bulk superconducting phases in Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2 induced by the external hydrostatic pressure effect are expected to be useful for evaluating the mechanisms of superconductivity in BiCh2-based superconductors.  \n",

We show on the single-impurity Anderson model how the quantum dynamics of strong electron correlations leads to the Curie-Weiss magnetic susceptibility sufficiently above the Kondo temperature. Such behavior has not yet been demonstrated and can be observed only when the bare interaction is substantially screened (renormalized) and a balance between quantum and thermal fluctuations is kept. We set quantitative criteria for the existence of the Curie-Weiss law.  \n",

In particular, the phase singularities of classical wave fields can lead to wavefront dislocations in the interference patterns. In quantum mechanics, the U(1) gauge invariance also enables manifestations of the wave function phase singularities in the context of topological phases of matter. If their topological properties are defined from the wave functions delocalised in the bulk, their main experimental manifestation is the existence of gapless excitations localised at the boundaries. Here we show wavefront dislocation as direct evidence of the phase singularity of the delocalised wave functions and observe it through standing-wave interference in a 1D microwave photonic insulator. By bridging the bulk topology of insulators to a ubiquitous wave phenomenon, we open a promising route to investigate the topological phases near topological defects in real-space interference.  \n",

In the shell model framework, we numerically study two valence neutrons in the $sd$ shell.

We prove these concepts by visualizing the phase and polarization using a newly developed polarimetric four-dimensional cathodoluminescence method.

The quantum side of the analogy (involving operators on Hilbert space with commutators scaled by Planck's constant $\\hbar$) not only gives the algebraic structure but also dictates the average values of physical quantities in the quantum ground state. On the other hand, the Poisson brackets of nonrelativistic mechanics, which give only the classical canonical transformations, do not give any values for physical quantities. Rather, one must go outside nonrelativistic classical mechanics in order to obtain a fundamental phase space distribution for classical physics. We assume that the values of physical quantities in classical theory at any temperature depend on the phase space probability distribution which arises from thermal radiation equilibrium including classical zero-point radiation with the scale set by Planck's constant $\\hbar$. All mechanical systems in thermal radiation will inherit the constant $\\hbar$ from thermal radiation.

Optical-lattice clocks (OLCs) now operate at or near the standard quantum limit (SQL) that arises from the quantum noise associated with discrete measurement outcomes. While performance beyond the SQL has been achieved in microwave clocks and other atomic sensors by engineering quantum correlations (entanglement) between the atoms, the generation of entanglement on an optical-clock transition and operation of such a clock beyond the SQL represent major goals in quantum metrology that have never been demonstrated. Here we report creation of a many-atom entangled state on an optical transition, and demonstrate an OLC with an Allan deviation below the SQL. We report a metrological gain of $4.4^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$ dB over the SQL using an ensemble consisting of a few hundred 171Yb atoms, allowing us to reach a given stability $2.8{\\pm}0.3$ times faster than the same clock operated at the SQL.

As well as being a counterintuitive statistical effect, we also show that our method can be applied to measure the strength of the noise on the device. The noise measured in this way is smaller than what is seen by other methods suggesting that the freeze time of a chain of coupled qubits on the device may be different than for isolated qubits with all couplings turned off, despite the fact that a qubit adjacent to a domain wall should effectively experience no coupling due to cancellation of the couplings one either side.  \n",

      "Spatial modes of light constitute valuable resources for a variety of quantum technologies ranging from quantum communication and quantum imaging to remote sensing. Nevertheless, their vulnerabilities to phase distortions, induced by random media upon propagation, impose significant limitations on the realistic implementation of numerous quantum-photonic technologies. Unfortunately, this problem is exacerbated at the single-photon level. Over the last two decades, this challenging problem has been tackled through conventional schemes that utilize optical nonlinearities, quantum correlations, and adaptive optics. In this article, we exploit the self-learning and self-evolving features of artificial neural networks to correct the complex spatial profile of distorted Laguerre-Gaussian modes at the single-photon level. Specifically, we demonstrate the possibility of correcting spatial modes distorted by thick atmospheric turbulence. Our results have important implications for real-time turbulence correction of structured photons and single-photon images.  \n",

We consider the bipartite scheme in which the quantum information is shared between an inertial observer (Alice) and an accelerated observer (Rob) in the case of Dirac field. We will show that this channel reduces the common quantum information between the two observers.

One is that the client just needs the ability to prepare single qubits initiated by Broadbent, Fitzsimons, and Kashefi, and the other is that the client only needs perform single-qubit measurements first given by Morimae. In this paper, we put forward a new model of BQC in which a user only requires implementing a few single-qubit gates.

While the intrinsic delayed response of the electronics can induce single mode and mutual heating between adjacent modes, we propose to counteract such detrimental effects by introducing an additional time delay to the feedback loop. For lossy cavities and broadband feedback, we derive analytical results for the final occupancies of the mechanical modes within the formalism of quantum Langevin equations. For modes that are frequency degenerate collective effects dominate, mimicking behavior similar to Dicke super- and subradiance. These analytical results, corroborated with numerical simulations of both transient and steady state dynamics, allow to find suitable conditions and strategies for efficient single or multimode feedback optomechanics.  \n",

We derive an analytical model of twin-beam experiments, incorporating experimental parameters such as the relative detection efficiency of the beams, uncorrelated optical noise, and uncorrelated detector noise. We show that for twin beams without excessive noise, measured correlations can be improved by increasing the detection efficiency of each beam, notwithstanding this may unbalance detection efficiency. However, for beams with excess intensity or other experimental noise, one should balance detection efficiency, even at the cost of reducing detection efficiency -- we specifically define these noise conditions and verify our results with statistical simulation.

Through runs on a D-Wave quantum annealer, we demonstrate that pausing in a specific time window in the anneal provides improvement in the probability of success and in the time-to-solution for these problems. The time window is consistent across problem instances, and its location is within the region suggested by prior theory and seen in previous results on native problems. An approach to enable gauge transformations for problems with the qubit coupling strength $J$ in an asymmetric range is presented and shown to significantly improve performance. We also confirm that the optimal pause location exhibits a shift with the magnitude of the ferromagnetic coupling, $|J_F|$, between physical qubits representing the same logical one. We extend the theoretical picture for pausing and thermalization in quantum annealing to the embedded case. This picture, along with perturbation theory analysis, and exact numerical results on small problems, confirms that the effective pause region moves earlier in the anneal as $|J_F|$ increases. It also suggests why pausing, while still providing significant benefit, has a less pronounced effect on embedded problems.  \n",

Here we demonstrate a method of adjustable momentum transfer that prevents the recombination of the spurious paths in a double-loop cold-atom interferometer aimed at measuring rotation rates. We experimentally study the recombination condition of the spurious matter waves, which is quantitatively supported by a model accounting for the coherence properties of the atomic source. We finally demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in building a cold-atom gyroscope with zero residual acceleration sensitivity. Our study will impact the design of multi-loop atom interferometers that measure a unique inertial quantity.  \n",
