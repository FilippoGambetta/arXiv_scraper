We show that this quantum critical point has non-Fermi liquid properties characterized by $T$-linear Planckian behavior, $\\omega/T$ scaling and slow spin dynamics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) type. The $\\omega/T$ scaling function associated with the electronic self-energy is found to have an intrinsic particle-hole asymmetry, a hallmark of a `skewed' non Fermi liquid.  \n",

This appears in de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations of the magnetisation with magnetic field as two close frequencies, corresponding to the two extremal Fermi surface cross-sectional areas. We show that, for layered materials of sufficiently high mobility, Coulomb interactions can have a dramatic effect on the form of the dHvA oscillations: there is also generically an oscillation at the small difference of the two large frequencies. We determine the size and form of this effect, and show that it probes the short-range part of the Coulomb interactions within the layered material. We argue that this interaction effect may explain recent experimental observations of anomalous low-frequency dHvA oscillations in the ultrapure delafossites.  \n",

      "The search for topological phases of matter is evolving towards strongly interacting systems, including magnets and superconductors, where exotic effects emerge from the quantum-level interplay between geometry, correlation and topology. Over the past decade or so, scanning tunnelling microscopy has become a powerful tool to probe and discover emergent topological matter, because of its unprecedented spatial resolution, high-precision electronic detection and magnetic tunability. Scanning tunnelling microscopy can be used to probe various topological phenomena, as well as complement results from other techniques. We discuss some of these proof-of-principle methodologies applied to probe topology, with particular attention to studies performed under a tunable vector magnetic field, which is a relatively new direction of recent focus. We then project the future possibilities for atomic-resolution tunnelling methods in providing new insights into topological matter.  \n",

      "Microscopic features of carrier localization, minibands, and spectral currents of InAs/GaSb based type-II superlattice (T2SL) mid-infrared detector structures are studied and investigated in detail. In the presence of momentum and phase-relaxed elastic scattering processes, we show that a self-consistent non-equilibrium Green's function method within the effective mass approximation can be an effective tool to fairly predict the miniband and spectral transport properties and their dependence on the design parameters such as layer thickness, superlattice periods, temperature, and built-in potential. To benchmark this model, we first evaluate the band properties of an infinite T2SL with periodic boundary conditions, employing the envelope function approximation with a finite-difference discretization within the perturbative eight-band $\\bf{k.p}$ framework. The strong dependence of the constituent material layer thicknesses on the band-edge positions and effective masses offers a primary guideline to design performance-specific detectors for a wide range of operations. Moving forward, we demonstrate that using a finite T2SL structure in the Green's function framework, one can estimate the bandgap, band-offsets, density of states, and spatial overlap which comply well with the $\\bf{k.p}$ results and the experimental data. Finally, the superiority of this method is illustrated via a reasonable estimation of the band alignments in barrier-based multi-color non-periodic complex T2SL structures. This study, therefore, provides deep physical insights into the carrier confinements in broken-gap heterostructures and sets a perfect stage to perform transport calculations in a full-quantum picture.  \n",

      "We show that [VO(TPP)] (vanadyl tetraphenylporphyrinate) is a promising system suitable to implement quantum computation algorithms based on encoding information in multi-level (qudit) units. Indeed, it embeds an electronic spin 1/2 coupled through hyperfine interaction to a nuclear spin 7/2, both characterized by remarkable coherence. We demonstrate this by an extensive broadband nuclear magnetic resonance study, which allow us to characterize the nuclear spin-Hamiltonian and to measure the spin dephasing time as a function of the magnetic field. In addition, we combine targeted measurements and numerical simulations to show that nuclear spin transitions conditioned by the state of the electronic qubit can be individually addressed and coherently manipulated by resonant radio-frequency pulses, thanks to the remarkably long coherence times and the effective quadrupolar coupling induced by the strong hyperfine coupling. This approach may open new perspectives for developing new molecular qubit-qudit systems.  \n",

      "We discuss superconducting pairing in a narrow conduction band sandwiched between unoccupied and occupied bands, an arrangement that enables an unconventional pairing mechanism governed by Coulomb repulsion. Pairing interaction originates from repulsion-assisted scattering between far-out pair states in the higher-energy bands and those at the Fermi level. Optimizing the bandstructure design and carrier density in order to bring plasma frequency below the bandgap renders the repulsion unscreened for the processes with a large frequency transfer. This allows the pairing to fully benefit from the pristine Coulomb repulsion strength. The repulsion-induced attraction is particularly strong in two dimensions and is assisted by a low density of carriers and the resulting low plasma frequency values. We assess the possible connection of this mechanism to superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene where the bandstructure features wide dispersive upper and lower minibands. We use a simple model to illustrate the importance of the far-out pairs in these bands and predict testable signatures of this superconductivity mechanism.  \n",

      "We study a weakly-interacting one-dimensional Bose gas with two impurities coupled locally to the boson density. We derive analytical results for the induced interaction between the impurities at arbitrary coupling and separation $r$. At $r\\lesssim \\xi$, where $\\xi$ denotes the healing length of the Bose gas, the interaction is well described by the mean-field contribution. Its form changes as the coupling is increased, approaching a linear function of $r$ at short distances in the regime of strong coupling. The mean-field contribution decays exponentially at arbitrary coupling for $r\\gg\\xi$. At such long distances, however, the effect of quantum fluctuations becomes important, giving rise to a long-ranged quantum contribution to the induced interaction. At longest distances it behaves as $1/r^3$, while at strong coupling we find an intermediate distance regime with a slower decay, $1/r$. The quantum contribution in the crossover regime is also calculated. The induced interaction between impurities (i.e., polarons) is attractive and leads to the formation of their bound state, known as bipolaron. We discuss its binding energy.  \n",

      "Single- and many-electron calculations and related dynamics are presented for a dimer and small Hubbard clusters. Floquet-Bloch picture for a periodic dimer is discussed with regard to the time dependence of the Peierls gap and the expectation of the current operator. In driven Fermi-Hubbard clusters, the time dependence of Charge Gaps and phase separation along with charge pairing at various cluster sizes indicate the presence and absence of paired electron states. We examine the effect of electromagnetic time dependent external perturbations on Hubbard many-electron systems in our search of for precursors to superconducting states and time crystals. Two principally different kinds of electromagnetic excitations are analyzed:(1) Recently demonstrated dynamic modulation of Hubbard parameters due to excitation of certain phonon modes within the far-infrared domain, and (2) Hubbard Hamiltonian, with fixed parameters in an electromagnetic field, resonant with transitions between the ground state and high-energy excited states as possible precursors to superconductivity, within visible-near-infrared domains.  \n",

      "Calculating the spectral function of two dimensional systems is arguably one of the most pressing challenges in modern computational condensed matter physics. While efficient techniques are available in lower dimensions, two dimensional systems present insurmountable hurdles, ranging from the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (MC), to the entanglement area law in tensor network based methods. We hereby present a variational approach based on a Chebyshev expansion of the spectral function and a neural network representation for the wave functions. The Chebyshev moments are obtained by recursively applying the Hamiltonian and projecting on the space of variational states using a modified natural gradient descent method. We compare this approach with a modified approximation of the spectral function which uses a Krylov subspace constructed from the \"Chebyshev wave-functions\". We present results for the one-dimensional and two-dimensional Heisenberg model on the square lattice, and compare to those obtained by other methods in the literature.  \n",

      "For quantum information applications utilizing single excitons and spins, the deterministic placement and control of a single optically driven quantum dot is a long standing goal. MoSe2-WSe2 heterostructures host spatially indirect interlayer excitons (IXs) which exhibit significantly longer lifetimes than monolayer excitons and unique spin-valley physics, making them promising candidates for quantum information applications. Previous IX trapping approaches involving moir\\'e superlattices and nanopillars do not meet the requirements for deterministic placement, nanoscale confinement, and energy tunability. Here, we use a nanopatterned graphene gate to create a sharply varying electric field in close proximity to a MoSe2-WSe2 heterostructure. The interaction between the permanent dipole moment of the IX and the electric field creates a deterministically placed, ~20 nm wide trap for the IXs. The trapped IXs show the predicted electric field dependent energy, saturation at low excitation power, and increased lifetime, all signatures of strong spatial confinement. Our architecture can realize deterministic trapping of single IXs, which has broad applications to on-chip scalable quantum information processing based on IX quantum dots.  \n",

      "Conductance signatures that signal the presence of Majorana zero modes in a three terminal nanowire-topological superconductor hybrid system are analyzed in detail, in both the clean nanowire limit and in the presence of non-coherent dephasing interactions with fluctuating impurities. In the coherent transport regime for a clean wire, we point out contributions of the local Andreev reflection and the non-local transmissions toward the total conductance lineshape clarifying the role of contact broadening on the Majorana conductance lineshapes at the magnetic field parity crossings. Interestingly, at larger $B$-field parity crossings, the contribution of the Andreev reflection process decreases which is compensated by the non-local processes in order to maintain the conductance quantum regardless of contact coupling strength. In the non-coherent transport regime, we include dephasing that is introduced by momentum randomization processes, that allows one to smoothly transition to the diffusive limit. Here, as expected, we note that while the Majorana character of the zero modes is unchanged, there is a reduction in the conductance peak magnitude that scales with the strength of the impurity scattering potentials. Important distinctions between the effect of non-coherent dephasing processes and contact-induced tunnel broadenings in the coherent regime on the conductance lineshapes are elucidated. Most importantly our results reveal that the addition of dephasing in the set up the does not lead to any notable length dependence to the conductance of the zero modes, contrary to what one would expect in a gradual transition to the diffusive limit. This work thus paves the way for systematic introduction of scattering processes into the realistic modeling of Majorana nanowire hybrid devices and assessing topological signatures in such systems in the presence of scattering processes.  \n",

In this way, we compute several correlation functions, which at leading order factorize into multipoint functions evaluated at different times for the two modes. Depending on the observable, the contribution from the massive or from the massless mode can be the dominant one, giving rise to exponential or power-law decay in time, respectively. Our results find a direct application in all the quench problems where, in the scaling limit, there are two independent massless fields: these include the Hubbard model, the Gaudin-Yang gas, and tunnel-coupled tubes in cold atoms experiments.  \n",

We contrast this with the analogous case of a topological insulator to normal insulator interface. The difference is that in the topological insulator the electromagnetic vector potential couples to a vector current in a theory with a Dirac mass, while in the superconductor a pair of Weyl fermions are gapped by Majorana masses and the electromagnetic vector potential couples to their axial currents.  \n",

      "Semiconducting single-walled carbon-nanotubes (SWCNTs) are an interesting material for strong-light matter coupling due to their stable excitons, narrow emission in the near infrared and high charge carrier mobilities. Furthermore, they have emerged as quantum light sources as a result of the controlled introduction of luminescent quantum defects (sp$^{3}$-defects) with red-shifted transitions that enable single-photon emission. The complex photophysics of SWCNTs and overall goal of polariton condensation pose the question of how exciton-polaritons are populated and how it might be optimized. The contributions of possible relaxation processes, i.e., scattering with acoustic phonons, vibrationally assisted scattering, and radiative pumping, are investigated using angle-resolved reflectivity and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on microcavities with a wide range of detunings. We show that the predominant population mechanism for SWCNT exciton-polaritons in planar microcavities is radiative pumping. Consequently, the limitation of polariton population due to the low photoluminescence quantum yield of nanotubes, can be overcome by luminescent sp$^{3}$ defects. Without changing the polariton branch structure, radiative pumping through these emissive defects leads to an up to 10-fold increase of the polariton population for detunings with a large photon fraction. Thus, the controlled and tunable functionalization of SWCNTs with sp$^{3}$ defects presents a viable route towards bright and efficient polariton devices.  \n",

      "The transport properties of junctions composed of a central region tunnel coupled to external electrodes is frequently studied within the single-impurity Anderson model with Hubbard on-site interaction. In the present work, we supplement the model with an important ingredient, namely the charge-bond interaction, also known as correlated or assisted hopping. Correlated hopping enters the second-quantised Hamiltonian, written in the Wannier representation, as an off-diagonal many-body term. Using the equation of motion technique, we study the effect of the correlated hopping on the spectral and transport characteristics of a two-terminal quantum dot. Two different Green functions (GFs) appear: one of them describes the spectral properties of the quantum dot, the other the transport properties of the system. The calculation of the transport GF requires the knowledge of the spectral one. We use decoupling procedures similar to those which properly describe the standard Anderson model within the Kondo regime and outside of it. For an arbitrary ratio $x$ between the amplitudes of correlated and single-particle hopping terms, the transport GF fulfils the $x \\leftrightarrow 2-x$ symmetry of the model. The average occupation of the dot also obeys this symmetry, albeit the spectral function of the quantum dot, calculated within an analogous decoupling scheme as for the transport GF, does not. We identify the physical reason for this behaviour, and propose a way to cure it. Since the correlated-hopping term breaks the particle-hole symmetry of the model and modifies all transport characteristics of the system, the detailed knowledge of its influence on measurable characteristics is a prerequisite for its experimental detection. Simple, experimentally feasible methods are proposed.  \n",

However, not much has been explored when a system undergoes a localization-delocalization transition. Here, we study one dimensional fermionic systems in presence of a quasi-periodic potential, which induces delocalization-localization transition even in 1D. We show signatures of DQPT in the many-body dynamics, when quenching is performed between phases belonging to different universality classes. We investigate how the non-analyticity in the dynamical free energy gets affected with filling fractions in the bare system and, further, study the fate of DQPT under interaction. Strikingly, whenever quenching is performed from the low-entangled localized phase to the high-entangled delocalized phase, our studies suggest an intimate relationship between DQPT and the rate of the entanglement growth -- Faster growths of entanglement entropy ensures quicker manifestation of the non-analiticties in the many-body dynamical free energy.  \n",

Using the corresponding analytical form factors of the quantum $E_{8}$ integrable model, we systematically study the spin dynamic structure factor of the perturbed quantum critical Ising chain, where particle channels with total energy up to 5$m_1$ ($m_1$ being the mass of the lightest $E_{8}$ particle) are exhausted. In addition to the significant single-particle contributions to the dynamic spectrum, the two-particle channels with different masses are found to exhibit an edge singularity at the threshold of the total mass and decay with an inverse square root of energy, which is attributed to the singularity of the two-particle density of states at the threshold. The singularity is absent for particles with equal masses due to a cancellation mechanism involving the structure of the form factors. As a consequence, the dynamic structure factor displays a cascade of bumping peaks in the continuum region with clear singular features which can serve as a solid guidance for the material realization of the quantum $E_{8}$ model.  \n",

These layered compounds are nonmagnetic and undergo charge density wave (CDW) transitions before developing superconductivity at low temperatures. Here we report the observation of unconventional superconductivity and pair density wave (PDW) in the vanadium-based kagome lattice CsV3Sb5 using scanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and Josephson STS. The differential conductance exhibits a V-shaped pairing gap about 0.5 meV below a transition temperature Tc about 2.3 K. Superconducting phase coherence is observed by Josephson effect and Cooper-pair tunneling to a superconducting tip. We find that CsV3Sb5 is a strong-coupling superconductor (2delta/kBTc about 5) and coexists with 4a0 unidirectional and 2x2 charge order. Remarkably, we discover a 4a0/3 bidirectional PDW accompanied by spatial modulations of the coherence peak and gap-depth in the tunneling conductance. We term the latter as a roton-PDW that can produce a commensurate vortex-antivortex lattice to account for the observed conductance modulations. Above Tc, we observe long-range ordered 4a0 unidirectional and 2a0 bidirectional CDW and a large V-shaped pseudogap in the density of state. Electron-phonon calculations attribute the 2x2 CDW to phonon softening induced structural reconstruction, but the phonon mediated pairing cannot describe the observed strong-coupling superconductor. Our findings show that electron correlations in the charge sector can drive the 4a0 unidirectional CDW, unconventional superconductivity, and roton-PDW with striking analogies to the phenomenology of cuprate high-Tc superconductors, and provide the groundwork for understanding their microscopic origins in the vanadium-based kagome superconductors.  \n",

      "Hamiltonian simulation represents an important module in a large class of quantum algorithms and simulations such as quantum machine learning, quantum linear algebra methods, and modeling for physics, material science and chemistry. One of the most prominent methods for realizing the time-evolution unitary is via the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. However, there is a large class of possible decompositions for the infinitesimal time-evolution operator as the order in which the Hamiltonian terms are implemented is arbitrary. We introduce a novel perspective for generating a low-depth Trotter-Suzuki decomposition assuming the standard Clifford+RZ gate set by adapting ideas from quantum error correction. We map a given Trotter-Suzuki decomposition to a constrained path on a graph which we deem the Pauli Frame Graph (PFG). Each node of the PFG represents the set of possible Hamiltonian terms currently available to be applied, Clifford operations represent a move from one node to another, and so the graph distance represents the gate cost of implementing the decomposition. The problem of finding the optimal decomposition is then equivalent to solving a problem similar to the traveling salesman. Though this is an NP-hard problem, we demonstrate the simplest heuristic, greedy search, and compare the resulting two-qubit gate count and circuit depth to more standard methods for a large class of scientifically relevant Hamiltonians with well-defined scaling behavior. We find that while our methods may or may not result in fewer two-qubit gates, in nearly every case the depth is significantly less using our methods. We also demonstrate that our methods are both scalable and efficient.  \n",

      "Whether self correcting quantum memories can exist at non-zero temperature in a physically reasonable setting remains a great open problem. It has recently been argued [1] that symmetry protected topological (SPT) systems in three space dimensions subject to a strong constraint -- that the quantum dynamics respect a 1-form symmetry -- realize such a quantum memory. We illustrate how this works in Walker-Wang codes, which provide a specific realization of these desiderata. In this setting we show that it is sufficient for the 1-form symmetry to be enforced on a sub-volume of the system which is measure zero in the thermodynamic limit. This strongly suggests that the `SPT' character of the state is not essential. We confirm this by constructing an explicit example with a trivial (paramagnetic) bulk that realizes a self correcting quantum memory. We therefore show that the enforcement of a 1-form symmetry on a measure zero sub-volume of a three dimensional system can be sufficient to stabilize a self correcting quantum memory at non-zero temperature.  \n",

Fluid Mech., vol. 736, 2013, pp. 594-615). The highly-resolved simulation data allows to compute the stress balance of the suspension in the streamwise and vertical directions and the stress exchange between the fluid and particle phase, which is information needed to infer the rheology, but has so far been unreachable in experiments. Applying this knowledge to the experimental and numerical data, we obtain the statistically-stationary, depth-resolved profiles of the relevant rheological quantities. The scaling behavior of rheological quantities such as the shear and normal viscosities and the effective friction coefficient are examined and compared to data coming from rheometry experiments and from widely-used rheological correlations. We show that rheological properties that have previously been inferred for annular Couette-type shear flows with neutrally buoyant particles still hold for our setup of sediment transport in a Poiseuille flow and in the dense regime we found good agreement with empirical relationships derived therefrom. Subdividing the total stress into parts from particle contact and hydrodynamics suggests a critical particle volume fraction of 0.3 to separate the dense from the dilute regime. In the dilute regime, i.e., the sediment transport layer, long-range hydrodynamic interactions are screened by the porous media and the effective viscosity obeys the Einstein relation.  \n",

      "Most water in the universe may be superionic, and its thermodynamic and transport properties are crucial for planetary science but difficult to probe experimentally or theoretically. We use machine learning and free energy methods to overcome the limitations of quantum mechanical simulations, and characterize hydrogen diffusion, superionic transitions, and phase behaviors of water at extreme conditions. We predict that a close-packed superionic phase with mixed stacking is stable over a wide temperature and pressure range, while a body-centered cubic phase is only thermodynamically stable in a small window but is kinetically favored. Our phase boundaries, which are consistent with the existing-albeit scarce-experimental observations, help resolve the fractions of insulating ice, different superionic phases, and liquid water inside of ice giants.  \n",

      "We investigate measurement-induced phase transitions in the Quantum Ising chain coupled to a monitoring environment. We compare two different limits of the measurement problem, the stochastic quantum-state diffusion protocol corresponding to infinite small jumps per unit of time and the no-click limit, corresponding to post-selection and described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. In both cases we find a remarkably similar phenomenology as the measurement strength $\\gamma$ is increased, namely a sharp transition from a critical phase with logarithmic scaling of the entanglement to an area-law phase, which occurs at the same value of the measurement rate in the two protocols. An effective central charge, extracted from the logarithmic scaling of the entanglement, vanishes continuously at the common transition point, although with different critical behavior possibly suggesting different universality classes for the two protocols. We interpret the central charge mismatch near the transition in terms of noise-induced disentanglement, as suggested by the entanglement statistics which displays emergent bimodality upon approaching the critical point. The non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and its associated subradiance spectral transition provide a natural framework to understand both the extended critical phase, emerging here for a model which lacks any continuous symmetry, and the entanglement transition into the area law.  \n",

      "Neural-network quantum states (NQS) have become a powerful tool in many-body physics. Of the numerous possible architectures in which neural-networks can encode amplitudes of quantum states the simplicity of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) has proven especially useful for both numerical and analytical studies. In particular devising exact NQS representations for important classes of states, like Jastrow and stabilizer states, has provided useful clues into the strengths and limitations of the RBM based NQS. However, current constructions for a system of $N$ spins generate NQS with $M \\sim O(N^2)$ hidden units that are very sparsely connected. This makes them rather atypical NQS compared to those commonly generated by numerical optimisation. Here we focus on compact NQS, denoting NQS with a hidden unit density $\\alpha = M/N \\leq 1$ but with system-extensive hidden-visible unit connectivity. By unifying Jastrow and stabilizer states we introduce a new exact representation that requires at most $M=N-1$ hidden units, illustrating how highly expressive $\\alpha \\leq 1$ can be. Owing to their structural similarity to numerical NQS solutions our result provides useful insights and could pave the way for more families of quantum states to be represented exactly by compact NQS.  \n",

      "Quantum circuits that are classically simulatable tell us when quantum computation becomes less powerful than or equivalent to classical computation. Such classically simulatable circuits are of importance because they illustrate what makes universal quantum computation different from classical computers. In this work, we propose a novel family of classically simulatable circuits by making use of dual-unitary quantum circuits (DUQCs), which have been recently investigated as exactly solvable models of non-equilibrium physics, and we characterize their computational power. Specifically, we investigate the computational complexity of the problem of calculating local expectation values and the sampling problem of one-dimensional DUQCs, and we generalize them to two spatial dimensions. We reveal that a local expectation value of a DUQC is classically simulatable at an early time, which is linear in a system length. In contrast, in a late time, they can perform universal quantum computation, and the problem becomes a BQP-complete problem. Moreover, classical simulation of sampling from a DUQC turns out to be hard.  \n",

With this in mind it might not be beneficial to use the usual standard gate sets, inspired from classical logic gates, when compiling quantum algorithms, when other less standardized gates currently perform better. We therefore consider a native gate, which occurs naturally in superconducting circuits, known as the diamond gate. We show how the diamond gate can be decomposed into standard gates and with the use of single-qubit gates can work as a controlled-not-swap (\\cns) gate. We then show how this \\cns gate can be used to create a controlled phase gate. Controlled phase gates are the backbone of the quantum Fourier transform algorithm and we therefore show how to use the diamond gate to perform this algorithm. We also show how to use the diamond gate in quantum machine learning, namely we use it to approximate non-linear functions and classify two-dimensional data.  \n",

      "Useful fault-tolerant quantum computers require very large numbers of physical qubits. Quantum computers are often designed as arrays of static qubits executing gates and measurements. Photonic qubits require a different approach. In photonic fusion-based quantum computing (FBQC), the main hardware components are resource-state generators (RSGs) and fusion devices connected via waveguides and switches. RSGs produce small entangled states of a few photonic qubits, whereas fusion devices perform entangling measurements between different resource states, thereby executing computations. In addition, low-loss photonic delays such as optical fiber can be used as fixed-time quantum memories simultaneously storing thousands of photonic qubits. Here, we present a modular architecture for FBQC in which these components are combined to form \"interleaving modules\" consisting of one RSG with its associated fusion devices and a few fiber delays. Exploiting the multiplicative power of delays, each module can add thousands of physical qubits to the computational Hilbert space. Networks of modules are universal fault-tolerant quantum computers, which we demonstrate using surface codes and lattice surgery as a guiding example. Our numerical analysis shows that in a network of modules containing 1-km-long fiber delays, each RSG can generate four logical distance-35 surface-code qubits while tolerating photon loss rates above 2% in addition to the fiber-delay loss. We illustrate how the combination of interleaving with further uses of non-local fiber connections can reduce the cost of logical operations and facilitate the implementation of unconventional geometries such as periodic boundaries or stellated surface codes. Interleaving applies beyond purely optical architectures, and can also turn many small disconnected matter-qubit devices with transduction to photons into a large-scale quantum computer.  \n",

      "Interacting spin networks are fundamental to quantum computing. Data-based tomography of time-independent spin networks has been achieved, but an open challenge is to ascertain the structures of time-dependent spin networks using time series measurements taken locally from a small subset of the spins. Physically, the dynamical evolution of a spin network under time-dependent driving or perturbation is described by the Heisenberg equation of motion. Motivated by this basic fact, we articulate a physics-enhanced machine learning framework whose core is Heisenberg neural networks. In particular, we develop a deep learning algorithm according to some physics motivated loss function based on the Heisenberg equation, which \"forces\" the neural network to follow the quantum evolution of the spin variables. We demonstrate that, from local measurements, not only the local Hamiltonian can be recovered but the Hamiltonian reflecting the interacting structure of the whole system can also be faithfully reconstructed. We test our Heisenberg neural machine on spin networks of a variety of structures. In the extreme case where measurements are taken from only one spin, the achieved tomography fidelity values can reach about 90%. The developed machine learning framework is applicable to any time-dependent systems whose quantum dynamical evolution is governed by the Heisenberg equation of motion.  \n",

We implement such an anonymous quantum conference key agreement by sharing multipartite entangled states in a quantum network. We demonstrate the protocol with four parties and establish keys in subsets of the network - different combinations of two and three parties - whilst keeping the participating parties anonymous.

First, in terms of real symmetric concave functions on the probability simplex, the coherence of assistance and the entanglement of assistance are shown to be in one-to-one correspondence. We then introduce two classes of quantum states: the assisted maximally coherent states and the assisted maximally entangled states. They can be transformed into maximally coherent or entangled pure states with the help of another party using local measurement and classical communication. We give necessary conditions for states to be assisted maximally coherent or assisted maximally entangled. Based on these, a unified framework between coherence and entanglement including coherence (entanglement) measures, coherence (entanglement) of assistance, coherence (entanglement) resources is proposed. Then we show that the coherence of assistance as well as entanglement of assistance are strictly larger than the coherence of convex roof and entanglement of convex roof for all full rank density matrices.

Let $X$ be a graph with adjacency matrix $A$ and consider quantum walks on the vertex set $V(X)$ governed by the continuous time-dependent unitary transition operator $U(t)= \\exp(itA)$. For $S,T\\subseteq V(X)$, we says $X$ admits \"group state transfer\" from $S$ to $T$ at time $\\tau$ if the submatrix of $U(\\tau)$ obtained by restricting to columns in $S$ and rows not in $T$ is the all-zero matrix. As a generalization of perfect state transfer, fractional revival and periodicity, group state transfer satisfies natural monotonicity and transitivity properties. Yet non-trivial group state transfer is still rare; using a compactness argument, we prove that bijective group state transfer (the optimal case where $|S|=|T|$) is absent for almost all $t$. Focusing on this bijective case, we obtain a structure theorem, prove that bijective group state transfer is \"monogamous\", and study the relationship between the projections of $S$ and $T$ into each eigenspace of the graph. Group state transfer is obviously preserved by graph automorphisms and this gives us information about the relationship between the setwise stabilizer of $S\\subseteq V(X)$ and the stabilizers of naturally defined subsets obtained by spreading $S$ out over time and crudely reversing this process. These operations are sufficiently well-behaved to give us a topology on $V(X)$ which is likely to be simply the topology of subsets for which bijective group state transfer occurs at that time. We illustrate non-trivial group state transfer in bipartite graphs with integer eigenvalues, in joins of graphs, and in symmetric double stars. The Cartesian product allows us to build new examples from old ones.  \n",

Meanwhile, we purposefully induce our geometric manipulation by selecting the path configuration that is robust against the qubit-frequency-drift induced error, which is the dominant error source on realistic superconducting circuits and has not been deliberately addressed. Moreover, our proposal can further integrate with the composite scheme to enhance the gate robustness, which is verified by numerical simulations.

In particular, our algorithm for $k$-distinctness on $n$-sized $m$-valued arrays requires $O(\\log n + \\log m)$ qubits compared to $\\Omega(poly(n))$ qubits required by all the previous algorithms, and its query complexity is optimal for $k=\\Omega(n)$. We also study reductions between the above problems and derive better lower bounds for some of them. The time-complexities of our algorithms have a small overhead over their query complexities making them efficiently implementable on currently available quantum backends.  \n",

The {\\it Euclidean discrepancy} problem and the problem of balancing covariates in randomized trials have efficient randomized algorithms based on the Gram-Schmidt walk (GSW). We frame these problems as quantum Ising models, for which variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are particularly useful.

      "The still-maturing noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology faces strict limitations on the algorithms that can be implemented efficiently. In quantum chemistry, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm has become ubiquitous, using the functional form of the ansatz as a degree of freedom, whose parameters are found variationally in a feedback loop between the quantum processor and its conventional counterpart. Alternatively, a promising new avenue has been unraveled by the quantum variants of techniques grounded on expansions of the moments of the Hamiltonian, among which two stand out: the connected moments expansion (CMX) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 58, 53 (1987)] and the Peeters-Devreese-Soldatov (PDS) functional [J. Phys. A 17, 625 (1984); Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 9, 2899], the latter based on the standard moments <$H^k$>. Contrasting with VQE-based methods and provided the quantum circuit prepares a state with non-vanishing overlap with the true ground state, CMX often converges to the ground state energy, while PDS is guaranteed to converge by virtue of being variational. However, for a finite CMX/PDS order, the circuit may significantly impact the energy accuracy. Here we use the ADAPT-VQE algorithm to test shallow circuit construction strategies that are not expected to impede their implementation in the present quantum hardware while granting sizable accuracy improvement in the computed ground state energies. We also show that we can take advantage of the fact that the terms in the connected moments are highly recurring in different powers, incurring a sizable reduction in the number of necessary measurements. By coupling this measurement caching with a threshold that determines whether a given term is to be measured based on its associated scalar coefficient, we observe a further reduction in the number of circuit implementations while allowing for tunable accuracy.  \n",

      "Auto-correlated noise appears in many solid state qubit systems and hence needs to be taken into account when developing gate operations for quantum information processing. However, explicitly simulating this kind of noise is often less efficient than approximate methods. Here, we focus on the filter function formalism, which allows the computation of gate fidelities in the presence of autocorrelated classical noise. Hence, this formalism can be combined with optimal control algorithms to design control pulses, which optimally implement quantum gates. To enable the use of gradient-based algorithms with fast convergence, we present analytically derived filter function gradients with respect to control pulse amplitudes, and analyze the computational complexity of our results. When comparing pulse optimization using our derivatives to a gradient-free approach, we find that the gradient-based method is roughly two orders of magnitude faster for our test cases. We also provide a modular computational implementation compatible with quantum optimal control packages.  \n",

We show that although the phenomenon was obtained before for two qutrits, it can also be observed for two qubits, while still being at the single-copy level. We establish that the phenomenon is intrinsically connected to the concept of unextendible entangled bases, in the two-qubit case. In the process, we demonstrate a hierarchy of nonlocality among sets of two-qubit orthogonal pure states, where the nonlocality is in the sense of a difference between global and local abilities of quantum state discrimination. We present a complete characterization of two-qubit pure orthogonal state sets of cardinality three with respect to their nonlocality in terms of conclusive local distinguishability, the status for other cardinalities being already known.  \n",

      "Recently it has been demonstrated that it is possible to harvest quantum resources other than entanglement from a coherent scalar field. Employing time-dependent perturbation theory, we present a complete analysis of the conditions under which a spatially extended Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to the proper time derivative of the field can harvest coherence for any initial state of the field, as well as the energy cost that is required for each harvest. By studying harvesting under repeatable extractions it is proven that when the detector interacts with the field through a delta coupling coherence is catalytic. For a Gaussian smeared detector it is shown that harvesting from a coherent field depends on the phase of its amplitude distribution and its initial energy as well as on the mean radius of the detector and the mean interaction duration between the two. For a detector moving at a constant velocity and with a mean radius of the same order as its transition wavelength, we observe that, for relativistic speeds, coherence swelling effects are present the intensity of which depends on the dimension of the underlying Minkowski spacetime.  \n",

Recent years have seen a significant development of high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits). While qudits present higher photon information efficiency and robustness to noise, their use in quantum networks present experimental challenges due to the impractical resources required in high-dimensional quantum repeaters. Here, we show that such challenges can be met via the use of standard quantum optical resources, such as weak coherent states or weak squeezed states, and linear optics. We report a concrete design and simulations of an entanglement swapping scheme for three and four dimensional systems, showing how the network parameters can be tuned to optimize secret key rates and analysing the enhanced noise robustness at different dimensions. Our work significantly simplifies the implementation of high-dimensional quantum networks, fostering their development with current technology.  \n",

Recent studies suggest that quantum computers could extend the reach of lattice gauge theory in dramatic ways, but the usefulness of quantum annealing hardware for lattice gauge theory has not yet been explored. In this work, we implement SU(2) pure gauge theory on a quantum annealer for lattices comprising a few plaquettes in a row with a periodic boundary condition. Numerical results are obtained from calculations on D-Wave Advantage hardware for eigenvalues, eigenvectors, vacuum expectation values, and time evolution. The success of this initial exploration indicates that the quantum annealer might become a useful hardware platform for some aspects of lattice gauge theories.  \n",

      "Optical antennas made of low-loss dielectrics have several advantages over plasmonic antennas, including high radiative quantum efficiency, negligible heating and excellent photostability. However, due to weak spatial confinement, conventional dielectric antennas fail to offer light-matter interaction strengths on par with those of plasmonic antennas. We propose here an all-dielectric antenna configuration that can support strongly confined modes ($V\\sim10^{-4}\\lambda_{0}^3$) while maintaining unity antenna quantum efficiency. This configuration consists of a high-index pillar structure with a transverse gap that is filled with a low-index material, where the contrast of indices induces a strong enhancement of the electric field perpendicular to the gap. We provide a detailed explanation of the operation principle of such Photonic Gap Antennas (PGAs) based on the dispersion relation of symmetric and asymmetric horizontal slot-waveguides. To discuss the properties of PGAs, we consider silicon pillars with air or CYTOP as the gap-material. We show by full-wave simulations that PGAs with an emitter embedded in the gap can enhance the spontaneous emission rate by a factor of $\\sim$1000 for air gaps and $\\sim$400 for CYTOP gaps over a spectral bandwidth of $\\Delta\\lambda\\approx300$ nm at $\\lambda=1.25$ \\textmu m. Furthermore, the PGAs can be designed to provide unidirectional out-of-plane radiation across a substantial portion of their spectral bandwidth. This is achieved by setting the position of the gap at an optimized off-centered position of the pillar so as to properly break the vertical symmetry of the structure. We also demonstrate that, when acting as receivers, PGAs can lead to a near-field intensity enhancement by a factor of $\\sim$3000 for air gaps and $\\sim$1200 for CYTOP gaps.  \n",

As the first step, this paper proposes some basic metrics for quantum software, which mainly focus on measuring the size and structure of quantum software. These metrics are defined at different abstraction levels to represent various size and structure attributes in quantum software explicitly.

The crucial missing ingredient in earlier calculational attempts (both numerical and analytic) is the use of valid approximations to the full relativistic analysis. It is pointed out that the nonrelativistic time Fourier expansion coefficients given by Landau and Lifshitz are in error as the electromagnetic description of a charged particle in a Coulomb potential, and, because of this error, Marshall and Claverie's conclusion regarding the failure of radiation balance is invalid. Rather, using Marshall and Claverie's calculations, but restricted to lowest nonvanishing order in the orbital eccentricity (where the nonrelativistic orbit is a valid approximation to the fully relativistic electromagnetic orbit) radiation balance for classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation is shown to hold at the fundamental frequencies and associated first overtones.  \n",

      "In 2018, Renes [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 64, no. 1, pp. 577-592 (2018)] (arXiv:1701.05583) developed a general theory of channel duality for classical-input quantum-output (CQ) channels. That result showed that a number of well-known duality results for linear codes on the binary erasure channel could be extended to general classical channels at the expense of using dual problems which are intrinsically quantum mechanical. One special case of this duality is a connection between coding for error correction (resp. wire-tap secrecy) on the quantum pure-state channel (PSC) and coding for wire-tap secrecy (resp. error correction) on the classical binary symmetric channel (BSC). While this result has important implications for classical coding, the machinery behind the general duality result is rather challenging for researchers without a strong background in quantum information theory. In this work, we leverage prior results for linear codes on PSCs to give an alternate derivation of the aforementioned special case by computing closed-form expressions for the performance metrics. The noted prior results include optimality of the square-root measurement (SRM) for linear codes on the PSC and the Fourier duality of linear codes. We also show that the SRM forms a suboptimal measurement for channel coding on the BSC (when interpreted as a CQ problem) and secret communications on the PSC. Our proofs only require linear algebra and basic group theory, though we use the quantum Dirac notation for convenience.  \n",
