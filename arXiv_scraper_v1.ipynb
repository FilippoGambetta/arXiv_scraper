      "The quest for non-Abelian quasiparticles has inspired decades of experimental and theoretical efforts, where the scarcity of direct probes poses a key challenge. Among their clearest signatures is a thermal Hall conductance with quantized half-integer value in natural units $ \\pi^2 k_B^2 T /3 h$ ($T$ is temperature, $h$ the Planck constant, $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant). Such a value was indeed recently observed in a quantum-Hall system and a magnetic insulator. We show that a non-topological \"thermal metal\" phase that forms due to quenched disorder may disguise as a non-Abelian phase by well approximating the trademark quantized thermal Hall response. Remarkably, the quantization here improves with temperature, in contrast to fully gapped systems. We provide numerical evidence for this effect and discuss its possible implications for the aforementioned experiments.  \n",

      "We study the ground state phase diagram of a nonlinear two-photon Rabi-Hubbard (RH) model in one dimension using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. Our model includes a nonlinear photon-photon interaction term. Absent this term, the RH model has only one phase, the normal disordered phase, and suffers from spectral collapse at larger values of the photon-qubit interaction or inter-cavity photon hopping. The photon-photon interaction, no matter how small, stabilizes the system which now exhibits {\\it two} quantum phase transitions: Normal phase to {\\it photon pair} superfluid (PSF) transition and PSF to single particle superfluid (SPSF). The discrete $Z_4$ symmetry of the Hamiltonian spontaneously breaks in two stages: First it breaks partially as the system enters the PSF and then completely breaks when the system finally enters the SPSF phase. We show detailed numerical results supporting this, and map out the ground state phase diagram.  \n",

A 95, 043622 (2017)] to the case of arbitrary statistics. The one-particle reduced density matrix is expressed as the Fredholm minor of an integral operator with the kernel being the one-particle Green's function of free fermions at finite temperature and the statistics parameter determining the constant in front of the integral operator. We show that the numerical evaluation of this representation using Nystr\\\"{o}m's method significantly outperforms the other approaches present in the literature when there are no analytical expressions for the overlaps of the wave-functions. We illustrate the distinctive features and novel phenomena present in the dynamics of anyonic systems in two experimentally relevant scenarios: the quantum Newton's cradle setting and the breathing oscillations initiated by a sudden change of the trap frequency.  \n",

      "When a symmetry is spontaneously broken in solids, a new transport coefficient emerges. A famous example is the anomalous Hall coefficient associated with broken time reversal symmetry. Here we present a measurement of the analogous transport coefficient in solids with broken rotational symmetry, the spontaneous elastoresistivity coefficient, defined as the ratio of the spontaneous resistivity anisotropy to the spontaneous structural distortion. In the iron pnictides, the measured spontaneous elastoresistivity coefficient coincides with the value of the normal elastoresistivity attained at the critical temperature of the nematic phase transition, which in a Landau free energy framework implies that the resistivity anisotropy remains a valid proxy of nematicity above and below the transition. Building on this equality, we find a nearly four-fold enhancement of the spontaneous elastoresistivity coefficient with doping towards optimal superconductivity. Our result reveals a clear sign of quantum critical enhancement of the coupling between nematicity and conduction electrons.  \n",

      "The coupling of a spin to an underlying substrate is the basis for a plethora of phenomena. In the case of a metallic substrate, Kondo screening of the adatom magnetic moment can occur. As the substrate turns superconducting, an intriguing situation emerges where the pair breaking due to the adatom spins leads to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states, but also intertwines with Kondo phenomena. Through scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we analyze the interdependence of Kondo screening and superconductivity. Our data obtained on single Fe adatoms on Nb(110) show that the coupling and the resulting YSR states are strongly adsorption site-dependent and reveal a quantum phase transition at a Kondo temperature comparable to the superconducting gap. The experimental signatures are rationalized by combined density functional theory and continuous-time quantum Monte-Carlo calculations to rigorously treat magnetic and hybridization effects on equal footing.  \n",

      "The wake following a vessel in water is a signature interference effect of moving bodies, and, as described by Lord Kelvin, is contained within a constant universal angle. However, wakes may accompany different kinds of moving disturbances in other situations and even in lattice systems. Here, we investigate the effect of moving disturbances on a Fermi lattice gas of ultracold atoms and analyze the novel types of wake patterns that may occur. We show how at half-filling, the wake angles are dominated by the ratio of the hopping energy to the velocity of the disturbance and on the angle of motion relative to the lattice direction. Moreover, we study the difference between wakes left behind a moving particle detector versus that of a moving potential or a moving particle extractor. We show that these scenarios exhibit dramatically different behavior at half-filling, with the \"measurement wake\" following an idealized detector vanishing, though the motion of the detector does still leaves a trace through a \"fluctuation wake.\" Finally, we discuss the experimental requirements to observe our predictions in ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.  \n",

      "A low twist angle between the two stacked crystal networks in bilayer graphene enables self-organized lattice reconstruction with the formation of a periodic domain. This superlattice modulates the vibrational and electronic structures, imposing new rules for electron-phonon coupling and the eventual observation of strong correlation and superconductivity. Direct optical images of the crystal superlattice in reconstructed twisted bilayer graphene are reported here, generated by the inelastic scattering of light in a nano-Raman spectroscope. The observation of the crystallographic structure with visible light is made possible due to lattice dynamics localization, the images resembling spectral variations caused by the presence of strain solitons and topological points. The results are rationalized by a nearly-free-phonon model and electronic calculations that highlight the relevance of solitons and topological points, particularly pronounced for structures with small twist angles. We anticipate our discovery to play a role in understanding Jahn-Teller effects and electronic Cooper pairing, among many other important phonon-related effects, and it may be useful for characterizing devices in the most prominent platform for the field of twistronics.  \n",

The QHI has the Chern number $\\mathcal{C}=2$ as both spin components are in the same quantum Hall state. We add to the system a staggered potential $\\Delta$ along the $\\hat{x}$-direction favoring a normal insulator (NI) and the Hubbard interaction $U$ favoring a Mott insulator (MI). The MI is a N\\'eel antiferromagnet (AF) for small and a stripe AF for large NNN hopping. We investigate the $U$-$\\Delta$ phase diagram of the model for both small and large NNN hoppings. We show that while for large NNN hopping there exists a $\\mathcal{C}=1$ stripe antiferromagnetic QHI (AFQHI) in the phase diagram, there is no equivalent $\\mathcal{C}=1$ N\\'eel AFQHI at the small NNN hopping. We discuss that a $\\mathcal{C}=1$ AFQHI can emerge only if the effect of the spin-flip transformation cannot be compensated by a space group operation.  \n",

      "The recent reports of superconductivity in Nd1-xSrxNiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructures have reinvigorated interest in potential superconductivity of low-valence nickelates. Synthesis of Ni1+-containing compounds is notoriously difficult. In the current work, a combined sol-gel combustion and high-pressure annealing technique was employed to prepare polycrystalline perovskite Nd1-xSrxNiO3 (x = 0, 0.1 and 0.2). Metal nitrates and metal acetates were used as starting materials, and the latter were found to be superior to the former in terms of safety and reactivity. The Nd1-xSrxNiO3 compounds were subsequently reduced to Nd1 xSrxNiO2 using calcium hydride in a sealed, evacuated quartz tube. To understand the synthesis pathway, the evolution from NdNiO3 to NdNiO2 was monitored using in-situ synchrotron X ray diffraction during the reduction process. Electrical transport properties were consistent with an insulator-metal transition occurring between x = 0 and 0.1 for Nd1-xSrxNiO3. Superconductivity was not observed in our bulk samples of Nd1-xSrxNiO2. Neutron diffraction experiments at 3 K and 300 K were performed on Nd0.9Sr0.1NiO2, in which no magnetic Bragg reflections were observed, and the results of structural Rietveld refinement are provided.  \n",

      "The fractional quantum Hall effect is theoretically investigated, with numerical and algebraic approaches, for few ultracold neutral fermionic atoms, interacting via repulsive contact potentials and confined in a single rapidly rotating 2D harmonic trap. We consider spinor fermionic atom assemblies, where each orbital within a Landau level has also spin degrees of freedom. Going beyond the common approaches based on second-order correlations in the real space, our methodology will assist the analysis of experiments by providing benchmark results for $N$-body spin-unresolved, as well as spin-resolved, momentum correlations that can be measured with time-of-flight protocols. Our analysis shows that the few-body lowest-Landau-level (LLL) states with magic angular momenta exhibit intrinsic ordered quantum structures in the $N$-body correlations, like the rotating Wigner molecules, familiar in semiconductor quantum dots under high magnetic fields. The application of a small perturbing stirring potential induces, in the neighborhood of the ensuing avoided crossings in the LLL energy spectra, symmetry-broken states (pinned Wigner molecules), exhibiting ordered structures manifested already at the lowest level of first-order correlations. This behavior portrays characteristics reminiscent of the 'flea on the elephant' concept familiar from the mathematical treatment of spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomena. A specific configuration-interaction-calculated LLL state, corresponds to the Halperin (1,1,1) two-component orbital wave function and agrees with a rotating Wigner molecule. Analysis of the calculated LLL wavefunction also allows a two-dimensional generalization of the Girardeau one-dimensional 'fermionization' scheme, originally invoked for mapping of bosonic-type wave functions to those of spinless fermions.  \n",

We derive analytical expressions of properties, e.g., Rashba parameter, effective mass, band edge energy and orbital occupancy, as functions of material and tunable heterostructure parameters. While linear RSOC is dominant around the $\\Gamma$-point, cubic RSOC becomes significant at the higher-energy anti-crossing region. We find that linear RSOC stems from the structural inversion asymmetry (SIA), while the cubic term is induced by both SIA and bulk asymmetry. Furthermore, the SOC strength shows a striking dependence on the tunable heterostructure parameters such as STO thickness and the interfacial electric field which is ascribed to the quantum confinement effect near the LAO/STO interface. The calculated values of the linear and cubic RSOC are in agreement with previous experimental results.  \n",

The density of states for the 1/1 approximant shows a wide pseudogap structure near the Fermi level as commonly observed in various approximants of the QCs, whereas those for the 2/1 approximant do not show such a wide pseudogap. Instead of the wide pseudogap, the 2/1 approximant shows a remarkable narrow pseudogap at the Fermi level in contrast to the 1/1 approximant, which shows a shallow hump at the Fermi level within the wide pseudogap. This seems to be consistent with the experimental observation of the electrical resistivity, which increases with decreasing temperature from the room temperature down to around the superconducting transition temperature for the 2/1 approximant together with the QC, whereas it monotonically decreases for the 1/1 approximant.  \n",

      "Recently, a crystal Hall effect (CHE) has been predicted to occur in collinear bulk antiferromagnets with a non-centrosymmetric non-magnetic sublattice. The CHE may be interesting for application in spintronics due to its reversal with switching the non-magnetic sublattice, provided that suitable means for realizing this property are found. Here, we predict that the CHE is not only limited to bulk antiferromagnets but may also occur in heterostructures composed of compensated antiferromagnetic metals and non-magnetic insulators due to reduced symmetry at the interface. We further show that such an interfacial CHE (ICHE) can be made reversible in engineered heterostructures where an antiferromagnetic layer is sandwiched between two identical ferroelectric layers. We explicitly demonstrate these phenomena using density functional theory calculations for three material systems: a MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$/GeI$_{2}$ van der Waals heterostructure, an In$_{2}$Te$_{3}$/MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$/In$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ topological van der Waals heterostructure, and a GeTe/Ru$_{2}$MnGe/GeTe layered heterostructure composed of three-dimensional materials. We show that all three systems reveal a sizable ICHE, while the latter two exhibit a quantum ICHE and ICHE, respectively, reversible with ferroelectric polarization. Our predictions open a new perspective for the emergence of the CHE and its use in spintronics.  \n",

A pair of topological Dirac crossings is observed along the kz direction, in good agreement with the ab initio calculations, confirming the topological Dirac semimetal nature of the compound.

In this study, we fabricated a boron-doped diamond micro-electrode and an undoped diamond insulation on a beveled culet surface of the diamond anvil. By using the developed DAC, we demonstrated the electrical transport measurements for sulfur hydride H$_2$S which known as a pressure-induced high-transition temperature superconducting H$_3$S at high pressure.

In this paper, we study the projective transverse field Ising model, a stochastic model with two non-commuting projective measurements and no unitary dynamics. We numerically demonstrate that their competition drives an entanglement transition between two distinct steady states that both exhibit area law entanglement, and introduce a classical but non-local model that captures the entanglement dynamics completely. Exploiting a map to bond percolation, we argue that the critical system in one dimension is described by a conformal field theory, and derive the universal scaling of the entanglement entropy and the critical exponent for the scaling of the mutual information of two spins exactly. We conclude with an interpretation of the entanglement transition in the context of quantum error correction.  \n",

Our results reveal that the presence of impurities may lead to a miscible-immiscible phase transition due to the interaction of the impurities and the two condensates. Within the realm of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations we calculate the quantum fluctuations due to the different types of interactions. The breathing modes and the time evolution of harmonically trapped impurities in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous binary condensates are deeply discussed in the miscible case using variational and numerical means. We show in particular that the self-trapping, the miscibility and the inhomogeneity of the trapped Bose mixture may strongly modify the low-lying excitations and the dynamical properties of impurities. The presence of phonons in the homogeneous Bose mixture gives rise to the damping of breathing oscillations of impurities width.  \n",

Nevertheless, there is a remnant of integrability encoded in the dependence of diffusion constant on the impurity density. At small densities it is proportional to the square root of the density, instead of to the density as would follow from Matthiessen's rule.

Other modes carrying heat or even spin, valley etc. currents are much harder to control for their charge-neutral origin. This noticeable gap in the experimental studies of mesoscopic non-equilibrium superconductivity can be filled by going beyond the conventional DC transport measurements and exploiting spontaneous current fluctuations. Here, we perform the first experiment of this kind and investigate the transport of heat in an open hybrid device based on a superconductor proximitized InAs nanowire. Using shot noise measurements we observe a novel effect of Andreev heat transmission along the superconducting interface and fully characterize it in terms of the thermal conductance on the order of $G_\\mathrm{th}\\sim e^2/h$, tunable by a back gate voltage. Understanding of the heat-mode also uncovers its implicit signatures in the non-local charge transport.

With dot energies capacitively tuned by a planar graphite electrode, dot-assisted tunneling becomes highly sensitive to the graphene excitation spectrum. The spectra track the onset of degeneracy lifting with magnetic field at the ground state, and at unoccupied exited states, revealing symmetry-broken gaps which develop steeply with magnetic field - corresponding to Land\\'e $g$ factors as high as 160. Measured up to $B = 33$ T, spectra exhibit a primary energy split between spin-polarized excited states, and a secondary spin-dependent valley-split.

We consider the most influential two leading terms with anisotropy due to the tilted polarization of the on-site boson in the square lattice. For assuring the concreteness of our choice, we have applied both cluster mean-field theory (CMFT) and infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS), and compared the results of our model with previous ones where longer-range interaction was included. Next, we focus on the case where the azimuthal angle is fixed to $\\phi = \\pi/4$. Through the mean-field analysis in a fashion that imposes quantum spin operators into classical ones, we aim to search for the underlying phases, especially the supersolid. Our results indicate a competing scenario between phases that break different translational symmetries. With the help of CMFT and variational iPEPS, the phase boundaries predicted by the mean-field treatment are determined more precisely. Our discoveries elucidate the possible underlying supersolid phases which might be seen in the real cold-atom experiments under dipolar interaction. Moreover, our results indicate that an effective triangular optical lattice can also be realized by fine tuning the dipolar angles.  \n",

The selected amino acids interact with alumina particles in aqueous media and in a broader pH range, leading to hydrophobization of surfaces, which was more intense for amino acids with higher molecular mass (isoleucine and leucine). As a consequence, ultrastable foams with a longer lifetime (> 100 hours) were produced and the foam microstructure was preserved from ageing phenomena.

This results in an exponential reduction in the size of the configuration space that needs to be explored, which we show through numerical simulations, yields higher quality approximate solutions compared to the original QAOA routine. We outline a specific implementation for edge-disjoint path (EDP) problems related to traffic congestion minimization, numerically analyze the effect of initial state choice, and explore trade-offs between circuit complexity and qubit resources via a particle-vortex duality mapping. Comparing the effect of initial states reveals that starting with an ergodic (unbiased) superposition of solutions yields better performance than beginning with the mixer ground-state, suggesting a departure from the \"short-cut to adiabaticity\" mechanism often used to motivate QAOA.  \n",

We demonstrate that one-dimensional TSs, realized as optical spatial solitons in a planar dual-core waveguide with dominant quintic self-focusing, may be stabilized by SOC-like terms emulated by obliquity of the coupling between cores of the waveguide. Thus, SOC offers a universal mechanism for the stabilization of the TSs. A combination of systematic numerical considerations and analytical approximations identifies a vast stability area for skew-symmetric solitons in the system's main (semi-infinite) and annex (finite) bandgaps. Tilted (\"moving\") solitons are unstable, spontaneously evolving into robust breathers. For broad solitons, diffraction, represented by second derivatives in the system, may be neglected, leading to a simplified model with a finite bandgap.

However, molecules incorporating REIs, despite having advantageous properties such as atomically exact quantum tunability, inherent scalability, and large portability, have not yet been studied for QIP applications. As a first testimony of the usefulness of REI molecules for optical QIP applications, we demonstrate in this study that narrow spectral holes can be burned in the inhomogeneously broadened $^5$D$_0\\to^7$F$_0$ optical transition of a binuclear Eu(III) complex, rendering a homogeneous linewidth ($\\Gamma_h$) = 22 $\\pm$ 1 MHz, which translates as $T_2 = 14.5$ $\\pm$ 0.7 ns at 1.4 K.

      "Landauer's principle provides a perspective on the physical meaning of information as well as on the minimum working cost of information processing. Whereas most studies have related the decrease in entropy during a computationally irreversible process to a lower bound of dissipated heat, recent efforts have also provided another lower bound associated with the thermodynamic fluctuation of heat. The coexistence of the two conceptually independent bounds has stimulated comparative studies of their close relationship or tightness; however, these studies were concerned with finite quantum systems that allowed the revival of erased information because of a finite recurrence time. We broaden these comparative studies further to open quantum systems with infinite recurrence times. By examining their dependence on the initial state, we find the independence of the thermodynamic bound from the initial coherence, whereas the entropic bound depends on both the initial coherence and population. A crucial role is indicated by the purity of the initial state: the entropic bound is tighter when the initial condition is sufficiently mixed, whereas the thermodynamic bound is tighter when the initial state is close to a pure state. These trends are consistent with previous results obtained for finite systems.  \n",

Classically, the simulation of such reactions is limited by the unfavourable scaling of the computational resources as a function of the system size. While quantum computing exhibits proven quantum advantage for the simulation of real-time dynamics, the study of quantum algorithms for the description of non-adiabatic phenomena is still unexplored. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm for the simulation of fast non-adiabatic chemical processes together with an initialization scheme for quantum hardware calculations. In particular, we introduce a first-quantization method for the time evolution of a wavepacket on two coupled harmonic potential energy surfaces (Marcus model). In our approach, the computational resources scale polynomially in the system dimensions, opening up new avenues for the study of photophysical processes that are classically intractable.  \n",

Optimization by numerical reconstruction algorithms is possible but require thousands of photon-sparse frames, thus unavailable in real time. Here, we present an experimental fast correlated-photon imaging enhanced by deep learning, showing an intelligent computational strategy to discover deeper structure in big data. Convolutional neural network is found being able to efficiently solve image inverse problems associated with strong shot noise and background noise (electronic noise, scattered light). Our results fill the key gap in incompatibility between imaging speed and image quality by pushing low-light imaging technique to the regime of real-time and single-photon level, opening up an avenue to deep leaning-enhanced quantum imaging for real-life applications.  \n",

      "Digital quantum simulators can provide universal quantum computation outperforming all existing classical computers. One of they key applications of quantum simulators is to emulate the ground state of many-body systems, as it is of great interest in various fields from condensed matter physics to material science. Traditionally, in an analog sense, adiabatic evolution has been proposed to slowly evolve a simple Hamiltonian, initialized in its ground state, to the Hamiltonian of interest such that the final state becomes the desired ground state. Recently, variational methods have also been proposed and realized in quantum simulators for emulating the ground state of many-body systems. Here, we first provide a quantitative comparison between the adiabatic and variational methods with respect to required quantum resources on digital quantum simulators, namely the depth of the circuit and the number of two-qubit quantum gates. Our results show that the variational methods are less demanding with respect to these resources. However, they need to be hybridized with a classical optimization which can converge slowly. Therefore, as the second result of the paper, we provide two different approaches for speeding the convergence of the classical optimizer by taking a good initial guess for the parameters of the variational circuit. These approaches show significant improvement in the optimization procedure and thus allow for more efficient simulation of the variational methods on fairly shallow circuits.  \n",

A secondary purpose is to clarify the similarities and differences between the classical and quantum situations. The general philosophy in this note is to include the mathematically essential aspects of circuits but to omit any of the additional structures that are usually included for convenience. We shall, however, retain the assumption that circuits are finite; this assumption does no harm to the applicability of our approach and is necessary for some of our work.  \n",

      "Quantum theory permits interference between indistinguishable paths but, at the same time, restricts its order. Interference in single-particle correlations, for instance, is limited to the second order, that is, to pairs of single-particle paths. To date, all experimental efforts to search for higher-order interferences beyond those compatible with quantum mechanics have been based on such single-particle correlations. However, quantum physics is not bounded to interference in single-particle correlations. We here experimentally study higher-order interference in many-particle correlations using a two-photon-five-slit setup. We demonstrate that two-particle correlations exhibit nonzero interference up to the fourth order, corresponding to the interference of two distinct two-particle paths. We further show that fifth-order interference is restricted to $10^{-3}$ in the intensity-correlation regime and to $10^{-2}$ in the photon-correlation regime, thus providing novel bounds on the accuracy of quantum theory.  \n",

These results suggest that rather than striving to engineer away undesirable interactions during fabrication, we can largely mitigate their effects through careful characterization and control optimization.  \n",

The problem is to acquire high value images while obeying the attitude manoeuvring constraint of the satellite. In order to investigate close to real-world problems, we created benchmark problems by simulating realistic scenarios. Our results show that a tuned quantum annealing approach can run faster than a classical exact solver for some of the problem instances. Moreover, we find that the solution quality of the quantum annealer is comparable to the heuristic method used operationally for small problem instances, but degrades rapidly due to the limited precision of the quantum annealer.  \n",

This method can be applied to problems of imaginary time evolution and contraction of tensor networks on a quantum computer.  \n",

Recently, additional controls were applied to design feasible quantum metrology schemes. However, these approaches generally does not consider ease of implementation, raising technological barriers impeding its realization. In this paper, we circumvent this problem by applying closed-loop learning control to propose a practical controlled sequential scheme for quantum metrology. Purity loss of the probe state, which relates to quantum Fisher information, is measured efficiently as the fitness to guide the learning loop. We confirm its feasibility and certain superiorities over standard quantum metrology schemes by numerical analysis and proof-of-principle experiments in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system.  \n",

Here, we report on coherent light storage in Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$O$_3$ nanoparticles using the Stark Echo Modulation Memory (SEMM) quantum protocol. We first measure a nearly constant Stark coefficient of 50 kHz/(V/cm) across a bandwidth of 15 GHz, which is promising for broadband operation. Storage of light using SEMM is then demonstrated for times up to 40 $\\mu$s. Pulses with two different frequencies are also stored, confirming frequency-multiplexing capability, and are used to demonstrate the memory high phase fidelity.  \n",

      "In finite probability theory, events are subsets of the outcome set. Subsets can be represented by 1-dimensional column vectors. By extending the representation of events to two dimensional matrices, we can introduce \"superposition events.\" Probabilities are introduced for classical events, superposition events, and their mixtures by using density matrices. Then probabilities for experiments or `measurements' of all these events can be determined in a manner exactly like in quantum mechanics (QM) using density matrices. Moreover the transformation of the density matrices induced by the experiments or `measurements' is the Luders mixture operation as in QM. And finally by moving the machinery into the n-dimensional vector space over Z_2, different basis sets become different outcome sets. That `non-commutative' extension of finite probability theory yields the pedagogical model of quantum mechanics over Z_2 that can model many characteristic non-classical results of QM.  \n",

      "We suggest a method for fast and robust quantum-state transfer in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain, which exploits the use of next-to-nearest-neighbour (NNN) interactions. The proposed quantum protocol combines a rapid change in one of the topological edge states, induced by a modulation of nearest-neighbour interactions, with a fine tuning of NNN interactions operating a counter-adiabatic driving. The latter cancels nonadiabatic excitations from the edge state multiplicity to the energy bands. We use this shortcut technique for topological pumping of edge states on a single dimerized chain and also through an interface that connects two dimerized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains with different topological order. We investigate the robustness of this protocol against both uncorrelated and correlated disorder, and demonstrate its strong resilience to the former in comparison to traditional adiabatic protocols for topological chains. We show that introducing spatial correlations in the disorder increases the robustness of the protocol, widening the range of its applicability.  \n",

Based on these simulations, we find the upper bound of noise for these cases, establish its dependence on the quantum depth of the circuit and provide comparison among them. By extrapolation of the fitted thresholds, we predict what would be the typical gate error bounds when apply the Grover's algorithms for the search of a data in a data set as large as one million.  \n",

We analyze a quantum van der Pol system subjected to squeezing, which exhibits bistable excitability in the classical limit, by numerical simulations of the quantum master equation. We first demonstrate that quantum coherence resonance occurs in the semiclassical regime, namely, the regularity of the system's oscillatory response is maximized at an optimal intensity of quantum fluctuations, and interpret this phenomenon by analogy with classical noisy excitable systems using semiclassical stochastic differential equations. This resonance persists under moderately strong quantum fluctuations for which the semiclassical description is invalid. Moreover, we investigate even stronger quantum regimes and demonstrate that the regularity of the system's response can exhibit the second peak as the intensity of the quantum fluctuations is further increased. We show that this second peak of resonance is a strong quantum effect that cannot be interpreted by a semiclassical picture, in which only a few energy states participate in the system dynamics.  \n",
